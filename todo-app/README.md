# Hello World

Here we are. Our journey with React just started and we are about to learn the sh\*t out of it. We have our basic file structure set up, thanks to `create-react-app` and we will dig in to our first task.

**Story**
We will create a simple todo app. We will build all the functionalities from scratch so the users can be able to add new todos, check and uncheck todos as done and delete them.

**TODO**:

In this task we would like to:

1. Explore the folder structure and the javascript files. What's the entry point of our app? What is this funky html called [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)?
2. Let's try to print Hello World to our app, instead of the default message from React.
3. Let's get rid of what we don't need like unused images.
4. Lets move from .css to the powerhouse that is .scss.
